## Hi, I am Alberto.
Hi there, I'm Alberto! I'm a passionate Software Engineer based in Milan, who believes in the power of well-designed and clean code. I specialize in Functional Programming, bringing order to complexity through logic and clarity. I'm an advocate for Test Driven Design and Domain Driven Design as these methodologies enable the creation of robust and flexible software systems.

Open-source development holds a special place in my heart; I truly believe in the power of collaboration and the continuous learning opportunities it provides. I'm always open to contributing to, and learning from, projects that push the boundaries of technology and offer meaningful solutions.

I'm always eager to connect with fellow coders and tech enthusiasts, so feel free to reach out ðŸ¤™
